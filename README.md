## Description
This project is a daily planner that allows the user to input daily tasks between the hours of 9AM
and 5PM. 


## Features

As the user types the input is automatically saved to local storage.

As the day progresses the time blocks change color to indicate that 
a time block is in the past, present, or future by checking the current hour of the day
every minute.

Arrows are provided to add events to future days as well as the ability to go 
back in time to view past tasks that were input.
